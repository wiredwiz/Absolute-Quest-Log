# AQL API Compatibility Audit

**Date:** 2026-03-28
**Spec:** docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-28-aql-multi-version-foundation-design.md

This document maps every WoW API call used by AQL against all four target version
families. Produced during the Multi-Version Foundation sub-project.

## Legend

|---|---|
| ✓ | Works as-is, same signature and return type |
| ~ | Present but different signature, return type, or namespace |
| ✗ | Absent / removed in this version |
| ? | Not yet researched (see Notes column for reason) |

**Version families:**
- Classic Era 1.14.x — Classic Era, Season of Discovery, Hardcore (Interface 11508)
- TBC 2.x — TBC Anniversary (Interface 20505, current — fully working)
- MoP 5.x — Mists of Pandaria Classic (Interface 50503)

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GetQuestsCompleted()` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ~ | Retail: changed to `C_QuestLog.GetAllCompletedQuestIDs()` in 9.0.1; returns sequential table instead of associative |

| `QuestLogPushQuest()` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ~ | Retail 9.0.1+: use `C_QuestLog.PushQuest(questID)` instead. Global wrapper may still exist as stub. |

## 5. Quest Log Frame Globals

| API | Classic 1.14.x | TBC 2.x | MoP 5.x | Retail 12.x | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `QuestLogFrame` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | Retail: quest log integrated into World Map in 6.0.2; standalone frame removed |

| `ShowUIPanel(frame)` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Protected during combat since 8.2.0; available on all versions. On Retail, `QuestLogFrame` does not exist (see above), so the quest-log use case requires World Map API instead. `ShowUIPanel`/`HideUIPanel` themselves still exist. |

## 6. Quest Tracking

| `MAX_WATCHABLE_QUESTS` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ? | FrameXML constant. Could not verify current Retail value — test at runtime. If nil at runtime, treat as no cap or use a fallback value (e.g., 25). AQL's `TrackQuest` already guards on this constant. |
| `QUEST_WATCH_LIST_CHANGED` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Added 6.0.2 / backported to 1.13.2; available on all versions |

## 7. Turn-in Detection

| `QUEST_TURNED_IN` | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | Added 6.0.2 / backported to 1.13.2. Wiki lists TBC 2.5.5 but does NOT fire on TBC per runtime testing; use GetQuestReward hook instead. Args: questID, xpReward, moneyReward |

## Summary of Retail Migration Patterns

Most legacy quest globals were moved to the `C_QuestLog` namespace in Patch 9.0.1 (Shadowlands). The common patterns are:

| Legacy Global | Retail Replacement | Key Difference |
|---|---|---|
| `GetNumQuestLogEntries()` | `C_QuestLog.GetNumQuestLogEntries()` | Same signature |
| `GetQuestLogTitle(logIndex)` | `C_QuestLog.GetInfo(logIndex)` | Returns QuestInfo table |
| `C_QuestLog.GetQuestInfo(questID)` | `C_QuestLog.GetTitleForQuestID(questID)` | Renamed only |
| `GetQuestsCompleted()` | `C_QuestLog.GetAllCompletedQuestIDs()` | Sequential table |
| `GetQuestLogPushable()` | `C_QuestLog.IsPushableQuest()` | Renamed only |
| `AddQuestWatch(logIndex)` | `C_QuestLog.AddQuestWatch(questID)` | Takes questID |
| `RemoveQuestWatch(logIndex)` | `C_QuestLog.RemoveQuestWatch(questID)` | Takes questID |
| `SelectQuestLogEntry(logIndex)` | `C_QuestLog.SetSelectedQuest(questID)` | Takes questID |
| `IsUnitOnQuest(logIndex, unit)` | `C_QuestLog.IsUnitOnQuest(questID, unit)` | Takes questID |
| `QuestLogFrame` | World Map integrated | No standalone frame |
| `QuestLog_SetSelection()` | `C_QuestLog.SetSelectedQuest()` | FrameXML removed |
| `QuestLog_Update()` | *(none)* | Auto-updates |

## Provider Availability by Version

The AQL provider system (Questie, QuestWeaver, NullProvider) supplies chain info, quest
type, and prerequisite data that is not available from the WoW client API directly.

| Provider | Classic 1.14.x | TBC 2.x | MoP 5.x | Retail 12.x | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Questie | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | No Retail version exists |
| QuestWeaver | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | Classic Era and TBC only |
| NullProvider | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Always available as fallback |

**Retail note:** Neither Questie nor QuestWeaver exists for Retail. Chain info always
returns `knownStatus = "unknown"` on Retail. Quest type, level, and objective data are
available through native `C_QuestLog` APIs without a provider — this is sufficient for
most AQL functionality on Retail.

**MoP note:** Questie supports MoP Classic. QuestWeaver does not support MoP —
treat as NullProvider fallback on MoP.
